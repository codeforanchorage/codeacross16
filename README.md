###Plug in at 20
Anchorage DHSS project. Created an SMS service that you text to 1-907-331-6688 and then text your zip code and get a reminder to plug in your car if the temperature is going to be below 20 that night. Could be expanded to other cities.

###Real time bus data in Transit App
Created and R program to grab People Mover real time transit data and output it in GTFS-RT. [Transit App](http://transitapp.com/) added Anchorage on #CodeAcross weekend. Now residents can get real time ETAs on their smartphones.

###CartoDB animation of the first 50 days of SMS Real Time Bus Service
Code for Anchorage launched a real time SMS bus service where residents can find out the ETAs for buses just using a flip phone with no data plan. Text ABOUT to 1-907-312-2060. The service had been running for 50 days and we made an [animation](https://codeforamerica.cartodb.com/u/codeforanchorage/viz/951ad3d2-ea4b-11e5-9304-0ecfd53eb7d3/public_map) of the stops people had queried.

###Restaurant Inspection Data
[LIVES Data Repo](https://github.com/codeforanchorage/anc-LIVES) - test data that needs to be verified put into [Socrata Dataset](https://brigades.opendatanetwork.com/HEALTH/2015-Score-Inspection/ecxv-94e2)
